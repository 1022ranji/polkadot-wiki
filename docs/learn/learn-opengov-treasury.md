The Treasury is a pot of funds collected through a portion of block production rewards, transaction
fees, slashing, [staking inefficiencies](learn-staking.md#inflation), etc.

The Treasury funds are held in a [system account](./learn-account-advanced.md#system-accounts) that
cannot be controlled by any external account; only the system internal logic can access it.

OpenGov allows for managing funds through six tracks.

- Treasurer
- Big Spender
- Medium Spender
- Small Spender
- Big Tipper
- Small Tipper
